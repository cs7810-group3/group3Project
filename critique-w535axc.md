## Group That Presented Second: 
**Members:** Jehan Fernando, Christopher Menart, Alexander Moore.
### Summary
A self driving car trying to figure out when its best to merge on the right or the left lane,traffic control, intersections, avoiding any obsticles.

### Strengths
An interesting topic with tidy schemas and easy to follow demonstration. The presenters spoke really clearly and in an organized way.

### Weaknesses
The dataset was limited in the sense of location and rules might not be adaptive to other locations for example the UK where the driving is on the "opposite side". 

## Group That Presented Third: 
**Members:** Brandon Dave, Ryan Miller, Megan Noble.
### Summary
Information regarding our solar system that enhances space exploration.

### Strengths
A really interesting topic, I found the live query demonstration about the asteroid passing earth and its location really cool. The schemas were neat and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
Some parts were hard to follow due to more talking with not so much demonstration being on the slides.

### Retrospective

I found this course fun and "relaxing" in the sense of having easily acccessible information and feeling like I was in a safe space to ask any kind of questions. I believe it gave me a set of skills to create a knowledge graph from scratch about any kind of information with proper steps.
