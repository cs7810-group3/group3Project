# Use Case 

# Narrative 

* Should contain a top-level description of your use-case.<br>
* Should, at a minimum, answer the questions:<br>
  * Who are you supporting?<br>
  * What are their goals?<br>
  * Why is making a Knowledge Graph interesting -- or important -- for the use-case?<br>   
* Additional expectations: should be approximately 400-500 words -- or roughly one typed page.<br> 

# Competency Questions

* Should thoroughly describe your intended interactions and what data you will retrieve to support said interactions.<br>
* Should include no less than 10 competency questions.<br>

* Show all manufacturing companies that made X part during the years A to B.
* Show all parts needed to build an X type plane built in year A.
* Show the manufacturing companies that made the most types of parts during year A.
* Show all shared parts between plane type X and plane type Y from year A.
* Show all countries where X part is manufactured. (This would be the countries / locations of all manufacturing companies that make X part)
* Show the top A most common planes. (This would be the list on length A, of the planes with the highest count of total manufactured / made)  
* Are their connections between aircraft models and specific crash types?
* What aircraft have had part recalls, and are there trends?
* What aircraft manufacturers support part production for older aircraft and are there aircraft with no manufacturer support?
* What engines are compatible with what aircraft?
