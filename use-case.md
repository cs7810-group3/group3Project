# Use Case 

# Narrative 

* Should contain a top-level description of your use-case.<br>
* Should, at a minimum, answer the questions:<br>
  * Who are you supporting?<br>
  * What are their goals?<br>
  * Why is making a Knowledge Graph interesting -- or important -- for the use-case?<br>   
* Additional expectations: should be approximately 400-500 words -- or roughly one typed page.<br> 
* 
In our knowledge graph, we aim to support aircraft owners, pilots, and maintainers. Their end goal is to keep aircraft flightworthy, which means frequent maintenance. Maintenance sometimes means sending parts out for repairs or even replacing them altogether, but a large percentage of aircraft used today is more than fifty years old and their manufacturer may have gone out of business or been subsumed by a competitor. It can be difficult to know what companies are supporting the maintenance for what models based upon service logs and possibly out of date ownerâ€™s manuals. Keeping aircraft flightworthy also involves knowing what issues a specific model may be prone to, such as brakes on Cessna 140s leading to the airplanes flipping over on the runway, and knowing when parts are recalled. Recalls can happen decades after an aircraft is no longer in production.

# Competency Questions

* Should thoroughly describe your intended interactions and what data you will retrieve to support said interactions.<br>
* Should include no less than 10 competency questions.<br>

* Show all manufacturing companies that made X part during the years A to B.
* Show all parts needed to build an X type plane built in year A.
* Show the manufacturing companies that made the most types of parts during year A.
* Show all shared parts between plane type X and plane type Y from year A.
* Show all countries where X part is manufactured. (This would be the countries / locations of all manufacturing companies that make X part)
* Show the top A most common planes. (This would be the list on length A, of the planes with the highest count of total manufactured / made)  
* Are their connections between aircraft models and specific crash types?
* What aircraft have had part recalls, and are there trends?
* What aircraft manufacturers support part production for older aircraft and are there aircraft with no manufacturer support?
* What engines are compatible with what aircraft?
* Can you describe the relationship between airplane parts and their manufacturers in the knowledge graph?
* How would you query the knowledge graph to identify all airplanes manufactured by a specific company?
* What is the most common part used in airplanes and which manufacturer is associated with it in the knowledge graph?
* Can you provide a summary of the manufacturing dates for all airplanes in the knowledge graph and how they relate to the parts used in each aircraft?

* Should provide links and access dates for no less than five potential datasets.<br>
