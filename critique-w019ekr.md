# Critique Assignment

## The Driving Project Ontology
**Members:** Jehan Fernando, Christopher Menart, Alexander Moore
### Summary
This group took a dataset of images from cars driving in Germany and broke them down into information 
relevant to an autonomous vehicle making decisions on the road.

### Strengths
- Inclusion of weather type and temperature was very thorough.
- Extensive list of variables are checked in queries that would seem simple to a human driver.
- Distinction between traffic lights and traffic signs.

### Weaknesses
-	Given that certain areas of a city may be more or less busy than others, it seems difficult
to take useful assumptions across the whole city. Block by block might be more useful.
-	Doesn’t account for side blindspots in the car’s vision when querying for if the car can change lanes.
- Current time of day was mentioned by speaker but doesn't seem present on the schema.

## SOL of Life
**Members:** Brandon Dave, Ryan Miller, Megan Noble
### Summary
Ontology aimed at determining if an astroid in Earth's solar system is a good candidate for mining.

### Strengths
-	Thorough asteroid and observation sub-schemas.
-	Multiple sources of data per key notion. The NASA source is probably very reliable.
-	Competency questions seem practical for the context and achievable with available data.

### Weaknesses
-	Asteroid mining seems like a very expensive alternative to promoting sustainability on Earth. 
-	Data is stated to not be standardized across sources which may lead to problems if the knowledge graph
was applied.
- Project name recursion is neat but the name doesn't stand by itself very well.


## Class Retrospective
What went well:  I really liked that the majority of this class was one big hands-on assignment, and I 
think I got more out of that than sitting in lectures.

What could be changed: The class files were a bit difficult to navigate in pilot. Also, I came to the class
with prior experience using github, but my teammates mentioned finding it confusing. A tutorial in lecture
going through pull requests and such might be helpful in future semesters of the class.

Fun: 5/5

Usefulness: 4/5
