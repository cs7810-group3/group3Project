# Critique Assignment
**Author:** Sydney Woods

## Group 2 to present: The Driving Project
**Members:** Jehan Fernando, Christopher Menart, Alexander Moore.
### Summary
Self driving car - how to get from one point to another. Not talking about google maps for directions, but how to actually drive. Such as traffic laws (the ones we know as humans). Turn detections of items like traffic signs, into logic and actions for the self driving car to follow. Specifically they did work with streets in Germany.  

### Strengths
* I liked how they put the mini-schemas into dashed boxes in the all together version of their schema. It helped to show which parts came from which mini-schema they had just explained.
* The bolding of the text for the SPARQL queries made them much easier to read on the slides. Wish we had thought to do that.
* Gave an overview of their data, and gave a bit of a description of where they got it.
* Spoke clearly, seemed calm and well prepared. 

### Weaknesses
* I believe that the images their data came from were from streets in Germany. I did not understand whether the rules of the road and road logic their system used was based upon those from the US or those from Germany. It would have been helpful to be told which they were using / to clarify (guessing they used the ones from Germany if the data was from Germnay)
* Would have been good to keep the bold face consistant through the presentation on the edited datasets / additions and annotations Christopher made to the data.

## Group 3 to present: SOL of Life
**Members:** Brandon Dave, Ryan Miller, Megan Noble.
### Summary
Related to space. Goal of providing an accessible set of data? Asteroids related data for space exploration, government, ect. Limited to our soloar system since the ability to travel further in space is limited, there was no need for further data. Working specifically with the composition of asteroids and their classifications / types.

### Strengths
* Mentioned their pattern sources, which we did not do directly in our presentation. 
* Mentioned their data sources as well. 
* Noted corrections that they felt they should have made - in middle of mini-schema descriptions - could be considered a future work concept which is always good to talk about. Actually had a whole slide for future work.
* I liked how they put the mini-schemas into gray boxes in the all together version of their schema. It helped to show which parts came from which mini-schema they had just explained.

### Weaknesses
* Went through the use case pretty quickly, specifically the information before the competency questions.
* Did not check tht copying from the slide would work to run their queries. 

## Updates for Retrospective:
* Would have been more likely to learn the process by using a topic well understood - such as animals. I get that the concept is well overdone in the field, and leads to potential cheating, but I struggled to learn the topics this semester because I was trying to understand what needed to be done to make it correct in relation to planes more so than what needed to be done to make it be correct for the course requirements.
* Better organization of the resources would be helpful - took me at least two or three weeks to find the deliverables pages. Was struggling to find the links for each of the sources and systems we needed to use in Pilot. Knowing the time line in advance would have lowered stress.
